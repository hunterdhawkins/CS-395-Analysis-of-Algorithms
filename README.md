# CS-395-Analysis-of-Algorithms

This class was taken and completed at the University of Idaho during the Fall 2019 semester. We used C99 to gain an understanding of algorithms, there efficiencies (time and space), big O notation, and general steps to improve memory consumption and decrease run time.
